{"name":"Houston","tagline":"A zero-config, Django Admin-like Mongo Admin for Meteor","body":"About\r\n-----\r\nHouston (formerly Z-Mongo-Admin) is a zero-config Meteor Admin, modeled after [Django Admin](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/contrib/admin/). Houston is available through the [Atmosphere](https://atmosphere.meteor.com/package/houston) package manager.\r\n\r\n### Getting Started\r\n```\r\nmrt add houston\r\n```\r\n\r\nOnce installed, navigate to `/admin` to set up your admin account. You can either create a new user to act as Houston's Admin, or upgrade an existing user into an admin by going to /admin with a logged in user.  \r\n\r\n### Demo\r\n\r\nTODO sample app/admin\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why Houston?\r\n* It's nice to give a client (or end-user) an admin UI without too much additional work\r\n* Often, in development it's nice to pop in and explore or update your data without dealing with a mongo shell.\r\n\r\nFeatures\r\n========\r\n\r\n#### /admin: Get a list of available collections\r\n![Home View](https://raw.github.com/gterrono/meteor-admin-ui/master/doc/home.png)\r\n\r\n#### /admin/collection: View all items in collection\r\n![Collection View](https://raw.github.com/gterrono/meteor-admin-ui/master/doc/collection.png)\r\n\r\nCollection view includes support for \r\n- deleting and creating documents\r\n- inline editing (double-click on a cell)\r\n- filtering and sorting by names\r\n- support for nested objects\r\n- (limited, mostly read-only) support for arrays\r\n\r\n#### /admin/collection/document_id: Edit a particular document\r\n![Document View](https://raw.github.com/gterrono/meteor-admin-ui/master/doc/document.png)\r\n\r\n#### /admin/login: User-defined Admin based on Meteor Accounts\r\n![Login](https://raw.github.com/gterrono/meteor-admin-ui/master/doc/login.png)\r\n\r\nDependencies\r\n-----\r\n\r\n* **Router**: As of v1.0, Houston is compatible with both IronRouter and Router-less solutions that don't conflict with IronRouter. [Let us know](https://github.com/gterrono/houston/issues/new)\r\n* **Accounts**: Houston piggybacks on top of Meteor Accounts.  \r\n* **CSS**: Houston uses Bootstrap, but makes an effort to avoid having its CSS interfere with yours.\r\n* **Meteor**: Houston 1.0 was tested with Meteor 0.6.6.3, but there's no (strict) reasons that older versions shouldn't work.\r\n\r\nFeature Wishlist\r\n-------\r\n- custom admin roles: let package users write their own allow/deny scripts for admin types\r\n- Allow package user to add custom CSS or functionality buttons per collection / per view\r\n- full support for Arrays / all sorts of complicated nested documents\r\n- Log of all actions done on Houston and (though this is tough) ability to roll back actions.\r\n- arbitrary mongo filters should work again\r\n\r\nHistory\r\n-------\r\nHouston was originally created during the [Summer 2013 Meteor Hackathon](http://www.meteor.com/blog/2013/07/09/congratulations-to-the-meteor-summer-hackathon-2013-teams) by [@gterrono](https://github.com/gterrono), [@alexeymk](https://twitter.com/alexeymk), [@yefim](https://twitter.com/yefim) and [@ceasar_bautista](https://twitter.com/ceasar_bautista).\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
